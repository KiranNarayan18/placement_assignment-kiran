    "Q-2. Consider a dataset containing the heights (in centimeters) of 1000 individuals. The mean height is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. The dataset is approximately normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Based on this information, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. What percentage of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm\n",
    "    and 180 cm?\n",
    "    b. If we randomly select 100 individuals from the dataset, what is the probability\n",
    "    that their average height is greater than 175 cm?\n",
    "    c. Assuming the dataset follows a normal distribution, what is the z-score\n",
