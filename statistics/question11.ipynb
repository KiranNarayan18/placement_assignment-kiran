    "Two classification techniques, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), have differing presumptions on the data. While QDA permits various covariance matrices for each class, LDA presumes that each class has the same covariance matrix. When the assumption of equal covariance is true, LDA typically performs well, making it more reliable when there are few samples or when the data can be separated linearly. Overfitting is less likely to occur with LDA\n",

It is critical to test both methods on the same dataset to see which one performs better based on the data distribution, class separability, and relationship complexity."
